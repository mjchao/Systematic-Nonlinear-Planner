/* 
Suppose you have a graph with whose vertex count is given by "numVertices",
with the vertices labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., numVertices-1
You are given a container "orderings" of ordered pairs of integer (v1, v2),
representing directed edges v1 --> v2.

The function "topSort" takes orderings and numVertices as inputs,
and returns a pair of things. The first element of the pair, 
a vector of integers, is a topological sort of the input graph.
This means that it is a linearly ordered list of integers 
s_0, s_1, ... s_numVertices such that every edge (s_i, s_j) is such that i < j

The second element of the pair is a boolean that is true if the sort was
successful, and false if unsuccessful. A sort is unsuccessful if the input
graph contains a cycle.

A plan is order consistent if and only if it can be successfully 
topologically sorted - hence the usefulness of this function in our project.
A topological sort is also useful for taking a partially ordered plan
and making it into a linear sequence of steps, for ease of reading.
